authentic
“Highly sensitive people are too often perceived as weaklings or damaged goods. 
To feel intensely is not a symptom of weakness, it is the trademark of the truly alive and compassionate. 
It is not the empath who is broken, it is society that has become dysfunctional and emotionally disabled. 
There is no shame in expressing your authentic feelings.”
